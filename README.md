Range Tree [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marschall/range-tree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marschall/range-tree)
==========

A simple range tree based on a left-leaning red-black tree.

Ideal for cases where a range of keys (eg. BIN range) needs to be efficiently mapped to an object.
